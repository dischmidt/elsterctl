# Writing Style Guide

This guide defines wording conventions for `elsterctl` documentation,
comments, and user-facing CLI text.

## Scope wording

- Use `German tax office` / `German tax offices`.
- Do not use `tax authority` / `tax authorities`.
- Keep wording scoped to workflows with German tax offices through the
  German ELSTER tax portal.

## Language policy

- Primary project language is English.
- German terms are acceptable when strongly tied to German tax law or
  official ELSTER/ERiC terminology.

## Product naming

- Use `ELSTER` for the German tax portal.
- Use `ERiC` for the native client library.
- Use `elsterctl` for this CLI tool.
